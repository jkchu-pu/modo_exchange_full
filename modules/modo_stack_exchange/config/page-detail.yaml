#       Welcome to the objdef for the detail page of the ModoStackExchangeModule!
#       This object definition defines three major areas of content, each as a KGOUIObject or collection of KGOUIObjects
#           1)  KGOUIDetailModoStackExchange, which is the root object and directly handles displaying the title, author, and avatar thumbnail
#           2)  KGOUIHTML, which displays the question body
#           3)  KGOUIList, which displays a collection of KGOUIListItemModoStackExchangeAnswer objects. Each used to display data about the answer KGODataObject
