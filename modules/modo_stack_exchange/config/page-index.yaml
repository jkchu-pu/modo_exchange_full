#       Welcome to the objdef for the index page of the ModoStackExchangeModule!
#       This object definition defines two major areas of content
#           1)  KGOUISearchModoStackExchange, which represents a search field. When a query is made, the user will be sent to the search page to view search results
#           2)  KGOUIList, which displays a collection of KGOUIListItem objects for the Stack Exchange "Featured Questions". Each item will navigate to a detail page
